## Overview

Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning web application built on Streamlit that provides a clean, accessible interface for a trained predictive model. The application takes structured user input, preprocesses it through a scikit-learn Pipeline, and returns model predictions with confidence scores and explanatory visualisations.

The project follows a full ML lifecycle: data collection and EDA, feature engineering, model training and cross-validation, serialisation, and deployment as an interactive web application. All preprocessing steps are encapsulated in a Pipeline object to guarantee consistency between training and inference environments.

An embedded model evaluation module allows users to inspect the trained model's performance on the held-out test set, view the confusion matrix or regression residual plots, and compare multiple candidate models before selecting the deployment model.

---

## Motivation

This project was built to bridge the gap between a trained ML model and a non-technical end user. A model that lives only in a Jupyter notebook creates no value. Wrapping it in a clean, deployable Streamlit application makes it accessible, shareable, and immediately useful.

## Architecture

```
User Input (form / sliders)
        │
  sklearn Pipeline (scaler + model)
        │
  Prediction + Confidence
        │
  SHAP / Feature Importance Visualisation
```

## Features

### Input Interface
Validated form widgets covering all model features with sensible defaults and range constraints derived from the training data distribution.

### Model Inference
Trained scikit-learn pipeline loaded from a serialised joblib file at startup; inference is performed on every form submission.

### Confidence Display
Prediction probability or regression confidence interval displayed alongside the point prediction for transparent uncertainty communication.

### SHAP Explainability
Per-prediction SHAP waterfall chart showing individual feature contributions to the model output.

### Model Evaluation Panel
Confusion matrix (classification) or residual plot (regression) with accuracy, F1, AUC, MAE, RMSE metrics on the test split.

### Dataset Explorer
Interactive table and chart view of the training dataset with filtering, sorting, and distribution visualisations.

### Batch CSV Prediction
Upload a CSV file for bulk inference; results are returned as a downloadable table with predictions and confidence scores.

### Responsive Layout
Mobile-compatible Streamlit layout with sidebar controls and main panel visualisations.
